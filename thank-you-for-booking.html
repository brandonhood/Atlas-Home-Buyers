    <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      <details>
        <summary>Do I need to make repairs or clean the house first?</summary>
        <p>
          No. We buy homes in as-is condition — even if they need repairs, cleanup, or updates.
          You don’t need to fix anything or prepare the house, even after you accept our offer.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How fast can you close?</summary>
        <p>
          We can close in as little as 7–14 days, but the timeline is up to you.
          If you need more time to move, coordinate, or handle personal matters, we’ll work around your schedule.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Are there any commissions, fees, or hidden costs?</summary>
        <p>
          No. There are no commissions, no agent fees, and no closing costs.
          The offer you receive is the amount you’d receive at closing, subject to a quick property review.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What happens after I submit my address?</summary>
        <p>
          Once you submit your address, a local home buying specialist will call you for a short, no-obligation conversation.
          We’ll ask a few questions, explain your options, and help you decide what is best for you — even if selling isn’t the right move.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can you still help if I owe money, have liens, or am behind on payments?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes — many homeowners we work with are dealing with liens, past-due payments, or other financial pressure.
          During the consultation, we’ll review your situation and explain what options may be available.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What if I’m not sure I’m ready to sell yet?</summary>
        <p>
          That’s completely okay.
          The initial conversation is simply to help you understand your options so you can make the best decision for your situation — with no obligation to move forward.
